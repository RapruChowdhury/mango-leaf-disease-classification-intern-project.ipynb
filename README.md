# Mango Leaf Disease Classification using CNN and Grad-CAM

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify diseases in mango leaves from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It also incorporates **Grad-CAM** visualization to interpret and highlight important regions in the leaf images that influence the model's predictions.

The entire workflow is designed to run smoothly on **Google Colaboratory (Colab)**, leveraging free GPU acceleration for efficient training and evaluation.
